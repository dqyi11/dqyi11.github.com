title: Machine-Dominant Human Intelligence
---
I had a roadtrip to north California on Christmas. We used the Google map for planning and navigation from a location to another. The drives were tedious and long. Almost all of the turns and lane changes were instructed by what the app told. I felt my body was in-the-loop of an autonoums driving system. Such a system consists of

* a high-level planner (the Google map app),
* a low-level actuator (the car), and
* a middle-level controller (myself).

The structure of this human-machine system led to many annoying experiences in the trip.

**Conflicts are occurred due to the lack of behavior diversity.** We know that 
> all roads lead to Rome.

But the Google map app only provides the optimized roads to "Rome".
When all the drivers who go to Rome run on the exactly same routine, there comes a traffic jam. 
Some drivers might be flexible to make a different turn for a different routine.
But in a strange city, most of them tend to follow what are instructed.
On the way to the Lombard Street, I could tell many cars were going to the same destination, because we made same turns at all the crosses.
Together, we were all trapped in a jam in a street that was two blocks away from the destination.

**Incorrect information is spreaded.**
