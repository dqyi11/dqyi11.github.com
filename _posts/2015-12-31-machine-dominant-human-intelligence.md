I had a roadtrip to north California on Christmas. We used the Google map for planning and navigation from a location to another. The drives were tedious and long. Almost all of the turns and lane changes were instructed by what the app told. I felt my body was in-the-loop of an autonoums driving system. Such a system consists of
* a high-level planner (the Google map app),
* a low-level actuator (the car), and
* a middle-level controller (myself).
