title: Start From "Big Brother Management"
---
I am a strong believer that the world is going to be changed by **artificial intelligence**.
Like the precedessors, steamer, electricty, computer and internet, the power of artificial intelligence is re-innovating many aspects of human's life.
*Management* seems to be one of those that are starting to change.
I read a very interesting and also scary article today, which is titled "big brother management".
